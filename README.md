   About The Project
   -----------------
The program acquires three-dimensional feature points through a single module camera. It receives a video as an input and estimates a baseline using the accelerometer value. Match the feature points between frames and find the disparity through the matched feature points. The depth value is obtained through disparity and the depth value of the next frame is optimized based on the key frame.
